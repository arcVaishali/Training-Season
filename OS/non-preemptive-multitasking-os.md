# Cooperative Multitasking 
### Non-Preemptive Multitasking

The concept of processes voluntarily yielding control periodically is a key principle in cooperative multitasking, a type of multitasking system. Here’s a detailed explanation of how this works and its implications:

### Cooperative Multitasking:
### Definition:

Cooperative multitasking is a method where processes running on the CPU voluntarily give up control so that other processes can run. This is in contrast to preemptive multitasking, where the operating system forcibly interrupts processes to switch between them.

### Voluntary Yielding:

In cooperative multitasking, each process is responsible for periodically yielding control to the operating system or other processes. This means that a process must be designed to be well-behaved and to share the CPU with others.

## How It Works:
### Process Execution:

When a process starts running, it executes a set of instructions. After completing a certain amount of work or reaching a logical stopping point, it explicitly calls a yield function or performs some action that indicates it's willing to give up the CPU.

### Yield Points:

Yield points are specific places in the code where the process checks if it should yield control. These points could be:
1. After processing a certain number of instructions.
2. At the end of a task or subroutine.
3. When waiting for I/O operations to complete.

### Context Switching:

When a process yields, the operating system performs a context switch. This involves saving the current state of the process (such as the values in the CPU registers, program counter, etc.) and restoring the state of the next process to be executed.
The next process in the queue (or the highest-priority process, depending on the scheduling algorithm) then starts running.

## Advantages and Disadvantages:
### Advantages:

- Simplicity:
Cooperative multitasking is simpler to implement because the operating system doesn’t need to manage complex preemptive scheduling and context switching.

- Predictability:
Processes yield control at predictable points, which can make the system’s behavior easier to understand and debug.

### Disadvantages:

- Responsibility on Processes:

The system relies on all processes to be well-behaved. If a process fails to yield (e.g., enters an infinite loop or runs a long computation without yielding), it can hog the CPU and starve other processes.

- Poor Responsiveness:

The system may become unresponsive if a process takes too long to yield, leading to poor user experience in interactive systems.


## Example Scenario:
1. Consider a simple system with three processes: A, B, and C.

#### Process A: Performs some computation and then yields control.

```c

void processA() {
    while (true) {
        // Perform computation
        // ...
        yield(); // Voluntarily yield control
    }
}
```
#### Process B: Reads input from the user and then yields control.

```c

void processB() {
    while (true) {
        // Read user input
        // ...
        yield(); // Voluntarily yield control
    }
}
```
#### Process C: Writes output to a file and then yields control.

```c

void processC() {
    while (true) {
        // Write output to file
        // ...
        yield(); // Voluntarily yield control
    }
}
```


In this system, each process performs its task and then calls yield(). The yield() function is responsible for handing control back to the operating system, which then decides which process to run next. If any process fails to call yield(), it could prevent the other processes from running, highlighting the cooperative nature of this multitasking approach.

### Conclusion:
Cooperative multitasking relies on the goodwill of processes to share CPU time voluntarily. While simpler to implement, it requires careful design to ensure all processes yield control appropriately. This approach is generally used in older or simpler systems; modern systems often use preemptive multitasking for better responsiveness and fairness.
